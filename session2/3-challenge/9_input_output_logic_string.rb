# Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever
# you type in), she should respond with HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!, unless
# you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you
# (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938!
# You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.
#
# Hint: Don't forget about chomp! "BYE\n" is not the same as "BYE"
# (check the String cheatsheet if you need)
#
# remember, you can try your program by going to the terminal and typing   $ ruby 9_input_output_logic_string.rb
#
# example:
#
#
# USER:     $ ruby 9_input_output_logic_string.rb
# USER:     hi grandma.
# GRANDMA:  HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
# USER:     HI GRANDMA!
# GRANDMA:  NO, NOT SINCE 1938!
# USER:     bye
# GRANDMA:  HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
# USER:     BYE
def deaf_grandma
  if @text == @text.upcase && @text != ""
    puts  "NO, NOT SINCE 1938!"
  else 
    puts "HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!"
end
end

while text = gets.chomp!
  break if text == "BYE"
  @text = text
  deaf_grandma
end
