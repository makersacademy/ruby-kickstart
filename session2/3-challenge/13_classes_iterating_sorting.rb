# DO NOT STRUGGLE ON THIS PROBLEM FOR MORE THAN 30 MINUTES!!

# In this exercise you'll need to create two classes.

# One class is called User that keeps track of a person's username
# it should receive the username when initialized
# it should have a method add_blog which accepts a date and text
# it should have a method blogs which returns an array of all blogs the user has written
# they should be in reverse chronological order (newest first)
#
# The other class is called Blog that could be used to store an entry for your web log.
# The class should have a getter and setter methods: text , date , user
# its initialize method should receive the date, user , and text
# have a method called summary that returns the first 10 words from the text (or the entire text if it is less than 10 words)
#
# Two blogs should be equal to eachother if they have the same user, date, and text
# here is a partially filled out example of how to define the == operator:
#      def ==(other)
#        return self.date == other.date
#      end



# ==========  EXAMPLE  ==========
#
# lissa = User.new 'QTSort'
# lissa.username                  # => "QTSort"
# lissa.blogs                     # => []
#
# lissa.add_blog Date.parse("2010-05-28") , "Sailor Mars is my favourite"
# lissa.blogs                     # => [#<Blog:0x007fec28c49b88
#     @date=#<Date: 2010-05-28 ((2455345j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>,
#     @text="Sailor Mars is my favourite",
#       @user=#<User:0x007fec2902e5c8 @blogs=[...], @username="QTSort">>] 
#
# blog1 = lissa.blogs.first
# blog1.user                      # => lissa

# Blog.new Date.parse("2006-01-02"), lissa, "For the last time, fuck facebook >.<"              # we'll call this blog3
# Blog.new Date.parse("2010-01-02"), lissa, "Got a new job, cuz I'm pretty much the best ^_^"   # we'll call this blog4
# lissa.blogs                     # => [ blog1 , blog4 , blog2 , blog3 ] this is
# not how it will actually appear. Please see lines 28-32 for how unnamed blog objects will
# appear.
