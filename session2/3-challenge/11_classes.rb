# DO NOT STRUGGLE ON THIS PROBLEM FOR MORE THAN 30 MINUTES!!

# Write a program that outputs the lyrics for "Ninety-nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall"
# Your program should print the number of bottles in English, not as a number. For example:
#
# Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall,
# Ninety-nine bottles of beer,
# Take one down, pass it around,
# Ninety-eight bottles of beer on the wall.
# ...
# One bottle of beer on the wall,
# One bottle of beer,
# Take one down, pass it around,
# Zero bottles of beer on the wall.
#
# Your program should not use ninety-nine output statements!
# Design your program with a class named BeerSong whose initialize method
# receives a parameter indicating the number of bottles of beer initially on the wall.
# If the parameter is less than zero, set the number of bottles to zero. Similarly,
# if the parameter is greater than 99, set the number of beer bottles to 99
# Then make a public method called print_song that outputs all stanzas from the number of bottles of beer down to zero.
# Add any additional methods you find helpful.

    hundreds  = englishNumber write
    numString = numString + hundreds + ' hundred'
    # That's called "recursion". So what did I just do?
    # I told this method to call itself, but with "write" instead of
    # "number". Remember that "write" is (at the moment) the number of
    # hundreds we have to write out. After we add "hundreds" to
    # "numString", we add the string ' hundred' after it.
    # So, for example, if we originally called englishNumber with
    # 1999 (so "number" = 1999), then at this point "write" would
    # be 19, and "left" would be 99. The laziest thing to do at this
    # point is to have englishNumber write out the 'nineteen' for us,
    # then we write out ' hundred', and then the rest of
    # englishNumber writes out 'ninety-nine'.
