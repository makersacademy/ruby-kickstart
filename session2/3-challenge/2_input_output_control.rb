# Prompt the user for a number, then read it in and print out "hi" that many times
#
# Repeat this process until the user submits "bye", then say "goodbye" and end the program
# HINT: Check out example 2 if you get stuck

# example:
# PROGRAM: Enter a number
# USER:    4
# PROGRAM: hi hi hi hi
# PROGRAM: Enter a number
# USER:    2
# PROGRAM: hi hi
# PROGRAM: Enter a number
# USER:    bye
# PROGRAM: goodbye


# remember you can try your program out with              $ ruby 2_input_output_control.rb
# and when you think it is correct, you can test it with  $ rake 2:2

def hi_hi_goodbye
puts "Enter a number"
#puts gets.chomp == "bye" ? "goodbye" : gets.chomp.to_i.times {"hi "}


while true
  num = gets.chomp
  if  num != 'bye'
    puts "hi " * num.to_i
else num == 'bye'
  puts "goodbye"
  break
end
puts "Enter a number"

end
end

# This will just invoke the method if you run this program directly
# This way you can try it out by running "$ ruby 2_input_output_control.rb"
# but it will still work for our tests
