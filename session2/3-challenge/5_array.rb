# Write a function named mod_three which takes an array of numbers,
# and return a new array consisting of their remainder when divided by three.
# Exclude any numbers which are actually dividible by three.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# mod_three [0]  # => []
# mod_three [1]  # => [1]
# mod_three [2]  # => [2]
# mod_three [3]  # => []
# mod_three [4]  # => [1]
# mod_three [5]  # => [2]
# mod_three [6]  # => []
# mod_three [7]  # => [1]
#
# mod_three [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] # => [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]

def mod_three(numbers) 
  squares = numbers.to_a.map { |number| number%3 }   #first we craete new array with our (var%3)-remainder condition, define it as array;
  num_arr = squares.reject { |square| square == 0 }  #second put away all elements with 0;                
end
