# Install the following gems:
#   helloworld    https://rubygems.org/gems/helloworld
#   sinatra       https://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra
#   nokogiri      https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri
#
# Nokogiri has C code that it needs to compile, if this doesn't work for you, it's probably because you need a compiler:
#
#     Mac:        You need to install XCode http://developer.apple.com/xcode/
#     Linux:      Probably gcc, I'm not sure how to get it, because I don't use Linux, but there
#                 should be some sort of package manager like Synaptic or apt-get that will do it.
#     Windows:    You probably need the devkit: https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit
#
# Then require them in this document
#   Note: Even though you install helloworld, the name of the file you need to require is hello_world (with an underscore)

require 'hello_world'
require 'sinatra'
require 'nokogiri'
