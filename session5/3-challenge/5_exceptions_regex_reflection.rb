# There are many types of exceptions and errors in Ruby
# We want to get a list of them.

# If you struggle on this question for ~30 minutes and aren't getting anywhere, look at the solution, try to understand the code, then close the file, come back here, and try again to solve it. 


# We will assume that any constant whose name contains either
# "exception" or "error" anywhere in it, regardless of case,
# is either an exception or an error.
#
# The class Module contains a list of all globally available constants.
# Module's documentation is here http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.html
# Use the method (look through the documentation if you can't figure out which one it is)
# to get an array of all the constants, then use the Enumerable method called grep
# to extract from the Array the constants that are errors and exceptions
# grep documentation is at http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Enumerable.html#M003121
#
# The method grep is not defined on arrays. Yet I have just instructed you to use it. Why?
# (a question to make you think, it is not tested)
#
#
# Example:  list_of_errors_and_exceptions # => ['ArgumentError', 'NoMethodError', ...]
# (depending on your Ruby version, your results will either be Strings of Symbols)
