#  THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF CHALLENGE 1                                  #
#  YOU MUST HAVE CHALLENGE ONE PASSING BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS CHALLENGE   #

#
# If you struggle on this question for ~30 minutes and aren't getting anywhere, look at the solution, try to understand the code, then close the file, come back here, and try again to solve it.
#
# My boss can now add CSS classes from his controller, so he is happy.
# But there are a lot of controller methods, and so he has to go to a lot of different
# places and type things like body_class << 'admin'
#
# That is pretty redundant and not dry. It makes code confusing to read, so Rails has
# something called filters. My boss decided to use a before filter to set the CSS classes
#
# In his controller, he told Rails:
# before_filter :set_admin, :except => [:show, :index]
#
# Then he created the method that he told the before filter to invoke
# def set_admin
#   body_class << 'admin'
# end
#
# Rails now knows that when an HTTP request is going to be handled by this controller,
# if the controller method handling the request is anything other than the methods named show and index,
# that it should first invoke the set_admin method. And in that method, he sets the CSS class.
#
#
#
# The problem, is that there are several of these of these filters he wants to apply,
# and he wants to do it in _every_ controller. There are many controllers, and many classes
# and so this amounts to lots and lots of very redundant and simple code (we call this "boiler plate").
# So he called me over and said that he would like to be able to accomplish the same thing with just
# one line of code:
#
# css_classes 'admin', :except => [:show, :index]
#
#
# I looked at the documentation, and the before_filter can take a block instead of a method name
# It will pass in the controller being operated on, so you could instead write the before filter like this:
#
# before_filter :except => [:show, :index] do |controller|
#   controller.body_class << css_class
# end
#
#
# YOUR TASK: Write the css_classes method.
#
#
# EXAMPLE INVOCATIONS:
#
# class ProductsController < ApplicationController
#   css_classes 'product',   :only => %w(show)
#   css_classes 'secondary', 'admin_form', :only => %w(new edit index)
#   ...
#
# is the same as
# class ProductsController < ApplicationController
#
#   before_filter :only => %w(show) do |controller|
#     controller.body_class << 'product'
#   end
#
#   before_filter :only => %w(new edit index) do |controller|
#     controller.body_class << 'secondary' << 'admin_form'
#   end
#   ...
#
# ---------------
#
# class CategoriesController < ApplicationController
#   css_classes 'no_header', 'secondary', :only => [:sitemap, :search]
#   ...
#
# is the same as
# class CategoriesController < ApplicationController
#   before_filter :only => [:sitemap, :search] do |controller|
#      controller.body_class << 'no_header' << 'secondary'
#   end
#   ...
#
#
# HINTS:
#   * Don't bother requiring the other file. To avoid relative require issues, the test will do it for you.
#   * First think about where you need to put this method so that it will be available to all the controllers
#   * You are going to need to combine variable length parameters with an options hash. This can't be done in the method signature


class ApplicationController

  def self.css_classes(*params)
    options = params.pop if params.last.is_a? Hash
    options ||= Hash.new

    before_filter options do |controller|
      params.each do |css_body_class|
        controller.body_class << css_body_class
      end
    end
  end

end
