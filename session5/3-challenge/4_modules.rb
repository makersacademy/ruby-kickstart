# Well, we love being able to overload operators
# But it gets to be a tad tedious after a while.
#

# If you struggle on this question for ~30 minutes and aren't getting anywhere, look at the solution, try to understand the code, then close the file, come back here, and try again to solve it.

# Wouldn't it be great if we could write those methods one time,
# and have them work for any class we wanted to drop them into?
#
# Your mission then, is to write a module, OperatorGeneratorFromSpace,
# that uses the spaceship operator <=> to write the methods <, <=, ==, >, and >=
#
# The spaceship operator takes two arguments and returns -1, 0, 1
# depending on whether the left argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the right.
#       SPACESHIP OPERATOR EXAMPLES:
#         0 <=> 1     # => -1
#         1 <=> 1     # => 0
#         2 <=> 1     # => 1
#
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
#
# class Student
#
#   include OperatorGeneratorFromSpace
#
#   GRADES = [:freshman, :sophmore, :junior, :senior]
#
#   attr_accessor :age, :grade
#
#   def initialize(age, grade)
#     @age, @grade = age, grade
#   end
#
#   def <=>(student)
#     if age == student.age
#       GRADES.index(grade) <=> GRADES.index(student.grade)
#     else
#       age <=> student.age
#     end
#   end
#
# end
#
# Student.new(20, :freshman) == Student.new(20, :freshman)  # => true
# Student.new(20, :freshman) >  Student.new(20, :sophmore)  # => false
# Student.new(20, :sophmore) <  Student.new(20, :freshman)  # => false
# Student.new(20, :sophmore) <= Student.new(30, :freshman)  # => true
# Student.new(30, :sophmore) >= Student.new(20, :freshman)  # => true
