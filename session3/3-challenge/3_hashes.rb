# Write a method that takes a string and returns an array
# whose keys are all the downcased words in the string,
# and values are the number of times these words were seen.
#
# No punctuation will appear in the strings.
#
# Example:
# word_count "The dog and the cat" # => {"the" => 2, "dog" => 1, "and" => 1, "cat" => 1}

  str.downcase.split(' ').each_with_object(Hash.new(0)) { |i, count| count[i] += 1 }
