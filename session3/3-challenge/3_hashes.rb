# Write a method that takes a string and returns an array
# whose keys are all the downcased words in the string,
# and values are the number of times these words were seen.
#
# No punctuation will appear in the strings.

# Example:
# word_count "The dog and the cat" # => {"the" => 2, "dog" => 1, "and" => 1, "cat" => 1}
