# DO NOT STRUGGLE ON THIS PROBLEM FOR MORE THAN 30 MINUTES!! IT'S A TOUGH ONE :)

# Write a method, spiral_access, that takes a 2d square array (an array of arrays)
# and a block, and calls the block for each of the elements, in spiral order.
#
# HINT: This method is probably best sovled recursively
#
# Example:
two_d = [
  [ 1,  2,  3,  4, 5],
  [16, 17, 18, 19, 6],
  [15, 24, 25, 20, 7],
  [14, 23, 22, 21, 8],
  [13, 12, 11, 10, 9],
]
# order = []
# spiral_access two_d do |i|
#   order << i
# end
# order # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]

def spiral_acess(array2d,&block)
  size_a = array2d.length

end

def spiral(n)
  spiral = Array.new(n) {Array.new(n, nil)}     # n x n array of nils
  runs = n.downto(0).each_cons(2).to_a.flatten  # n==5; [5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,0]
  delta = [[1,0], [0,1], [-1,0], [0,-1]].cycle
  x, y, value = -1, 0, -1
  for run in runs
    dx, dy = delta.next
    run.times { spiral[y+=dy][x+=dx] = (value+=1) }
  end
  spiral
end
puts spiral(4)
