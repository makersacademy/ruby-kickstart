# Write a method first_object, that takes three parameters
# and returns the first one that is true.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# first_object 1, nil, nil    # => 1
# first_object nil, 1, nil    # => 1
# first_object nil, nil, 1    # => 1
# first_object nil, 1, 2      # => 1
# first_object nil, nil, nil  # => nil

def first_object(arg1, arg2, arg3)
  arg1 == false && arg2 == false && arg3 == false ? nil : arg1|| arg2 || arg3
end
