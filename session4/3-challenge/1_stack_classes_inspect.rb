# If you struggle on this question for ~30 minutes and aren't getting anywhere, look at the solutions file, try to understand the code, then close the file, come back here, and try again to solve it.

# A stack is a collection of objects, where when you add a new object to the collection,
# called "pushing", it becomes the first object that you remove from the collection,
# called "popping". Arrays can be used as stacks:
stack = Array.new
stack.push 1
stack.push 2
stack       # => [1, 2]
stack.pop   # => 2
stack.pop   # => 1
stack.pop   # => nil



# But I want to implement it using linked lists instead of arrays.
class Node
  attr_accessor :next_node, :data

  def initialize(next_node, data)
    @next_node = next_node
    @data = data
  end
end


class Stack
  def initialize
    @head = nil
  end

  def push(data)
    @head = Node.new @head, data
  end

  def pop
    to_return = @head && @head.data
    @head &&= @head.next_node
    to_return
  end
end
stack = Stack.new
stack.push 1
stack.push 2
stack         # => #<Stack:0x00000100862698 @head=#<Node:0x00000100862648 @next=#<Node:0x00000100862670 @next=nil, @data=1>, @data=2>>
stack.pop     # => 2
stack.pop     # => 1
stack.pop     # => nil


# Looks good, except that inspection is uuuuuugly. It's the default
# inspect method from Kernel, which knows nothing about our lists.
#
# I want you to override it so that I can do this:
stack = Stack.new
stack.push 1
stack.push 2
stack.push 3
stack # =>  (3)2)1)

class Stack
  def inspect
    output = "("
    current_head = @head
    while current_head
      output << current_head.data.inspect
      output << ")"
      current_head = current_head.next_node
    end
    output << ")" if output == "("
    output
  end
end

#p stack
